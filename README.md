# About the Vite/React App

This project is currently setup for GitHub Pages. Before running locally on your machine there's a few things you should definitely do:

1. Remove `base: '/vite-template-2026/'` from `vite.config.ts`
2. Remove `basename:  '/vite-template-2026'` from `src/App/router/index.ts`
3. Remove `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts from `package.json`
